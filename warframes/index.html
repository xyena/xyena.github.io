	    <li>What is this site?</li>
		<ul>
		  <li class="why1">This site is a compilation of my builds that I frequently use in Warframe that I have developed over the years. Though they were previously displayed in a Google document, I decided I wanted a little more control over the styling of the document, and to gain a little web development experience in the process.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Why should I use your guides and not someone else's?</li>
		<ul>
		  <li class="why1">These are all builds I have created, not ones that are borrowed from any other source. They have been tested against several missions and are optimized for different kinds of gameplay. Because I play so often and am always experimenting, I can personally guarantee this will be updated as long as I am playing.</li>
